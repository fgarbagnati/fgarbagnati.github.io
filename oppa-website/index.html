									We believe the right process can greatly improve quality, productivity, visibility and predictability.  To accomplish this, it needs to bring structure but cannot stifle creativity or slow things down.  We strive to achieve the right balance by working in collaboration with the team, adapting to the existing culture as much as possible, minimizing impact on roadmap projects, and ensuring that whatâ€™s in place is effective and improves consistently over time
								</li>
								<li>
									We have successfully transition teams from various processes to Agile (Scrum) and Continuous Integration (CI).  We go beyond the conventional approach (which does not always work for everyone, particularly in organizations that develop system software or hardware).  We had to overcome objections from team members (serious concerns expressed openly as well as passive aggressive behavior).

									it is not enough to have products and services that are robust and dependable, it is also important to deliver something that is easy to use and can be supported effectively in the field (all the way from pre-sales to break / fix).  In addition, given the importance of cloud, products need to be highly scalable and self-healing

						In addition, though our background is primarily R&amp;D, we believe that the world of IT is changing quite drastically, and successful companies (like Facebook and Google) have IT organizations that are closer to engineering than traditional IT.  As a result, we can help IT transition from conventional infrastructure to cloud.  We can also help manage initiatives and projects based on cloud technologies.

Many times, these patterns result in conflicts, disconnections, hurt feelings, disappointments, and a general sense of alienation and loneliness; and on top of this, folks begin to feel stuck, and even hopeless that things can get better.  \n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<h2>COUPLES</h2>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIn couples, both sides can begin to feel that they are misunderstood, or that they are “right”.  Each person begins to fall back on familiar-but-ineffective communication styles and conflict resolution styles.  This leads to diminished intimacy and closeness, high levels of conflict, various inhibitions, and, sometimes, infidelity.  In the end, I find that this can lead to questions about whether the relationship is even viable anymore.  A lot of folks in these circumstances choose to do couples therapy, in lieu of one-on-one therapy, as a means of examining and exploring relationship patterns and dynamics.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<h3>I help couples:</h3>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Hone and clarify the lenses through which they see each other</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Re-connect with feelings of love, tenderness, and closeness</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Develop, Improve, and Deepen communication and listening</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Explore relational values to clarify expectations and needs for each other, and from each other.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<h2>FAMILIES</h2>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIn families, members can find themselves mired in confusing and muddied relationships; sometimes families can get stuck on old patterns that no longer work as the family evolves and the children grow.  Inevitably, conflict, disconnection, and even loneliness can result.  I find that this can lead to: children “acting out”; parents either overly-asserting control, or throwing their hands up and not knowing what to do; children not trusting parents, and parents not trusting children.  A lot of folks in these circumstances choose to do family therapy in lieu of one-on-one therapy, as a means of examining and exploring intra-family dynamics.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<h3>I help families:</h3>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Understand the family system in such a way that each person’s behavior makes sense within a context</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Clarify and update roles and expectations, particularly as children transition to adolescence and young adulthood</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Create agreements whereby each person understands what is expected from them and from others</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Understand and share power in ways make sense to everyone and feel equitable to everyone</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t</Layout>\n)\n\n\n\n\n"],"sourceRoot":""}

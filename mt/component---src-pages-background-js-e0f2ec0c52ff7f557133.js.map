I’ve spent many years working with folks who experience intense internal experiences; this work has helped me develop a sensitivity to, and a comfort with, the myriad of ways that people express their pain, their suffering, and their desires.  \n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIn these trying times that we live in, these questions take on extra importance, as people search for meaning, connection, relationship, success, happiness, and a lens through which to make sense of things.  I help my clients to do this through a variety of reflective approaches: humanistic, relational, cognitive, psychodynamic, and existential.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<h2>Personal Therapy History:</h2>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tGrowing up, the idea of therapy wasn’t even a possibility, given my family beliefs and the time that I grew up.  Looking back, I wish I would’ve been able to find somebody to talk with, to help me explore and speak about questions and challenges that were, for me, unspeakable and ineffable.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSince my 20’s, I have engaged with multiple therapists who came from a variety of background and orientations: cognitive, mindfulness-based, relational, transactional, client-centered, Jungian, and psychoanalytic.  I was in Lacanian psychoanalysis with Phillipe Gendrault for several years, and I spent several years in a Jungian-based group therapy.  Some of these experiences were very positive for me; while others were not so positive.  What I learned is that the most important things are: somebody that can listen — deeply and reflectively; somebody that can refrain from giving too much advice or information; somebody that can help me speak myself more clearly and more deeply; and somebody that can listen to my pain without trying to “solve” anything and without trying to “fix” me.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<h2>Clinical Training:</h2>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFrom the beginning of my career, I have been anchored in the tenets of Rogerian, person-centered, therapy.  This approach embodies a deep, reflective, approach, and the “necessary and sufficient conditions of change”:\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Genuineness (i.e., “non-possessive warmth”).</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Unconditional Positive Regard</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Accurate Empathy</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIn the 90’s, I studied Mindfulness approaches and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).  In the early-mid 2000’s, I learned Motivational Interviewing and became a member of the Motivational Interviewing Network of Trainers in 2007 (of which I remain a member in good standing).\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAs my career has continued, I’ve studied and practiced a variety psychodynamic approaches, including Lacanian, Relational, and the teachings of Freida Fromm-Reichmann, Harry Stack Sullivan, Melanie Klein, Harold Searles, and Donald Winnicott.  I also studied Wellness Recovery Action Planning (WRAP), and Hearing Voices approaches.  I have developed and am currently writing a treatment manual on working with crisis states.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<h2>Current and Former Associations:</h2>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Motivational Interviewing Network of Trainers (MINT) </li>\n\t\t\t<li>International Society for Psychological and Social Approaches to Psychosis (ISPS)</li>\n\t\t\t<li>The Northern California Society for Psychoanalytic Psychology (NCSPP)</li>\n\t\t\t<li>The C.G.

Technology enables folks to have “the world at their fingers”, and yet many young people are feeling increasingly alone, isolated, and adrift in a world that seems to lack connection, relationship, meaning, beauty, and health.  These feelings are amplified and further knotted by the challenges facing the world today: global warming and climate change; war; poverty; increasing political divides and a lack of vibrant, moral leadership.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAt the same time, other TAY folks have experienced difficult events, traumas, and difficult environments that has them feeling even more stuck and even more alone.  Finally, all individuals in the TAY age range face challenges relating to life transitions, where they fit in (at school, or socially, or in physical, non-digital, environments), questions about identity and sexuality, questions about body image and one’s relationship to his/her body, coming of age questions, and questions about their futures.  These challenges and questions are faced differently, and have different implications, by folks based on genders and race and orientations and access to resources.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWorking with young people is one of the joys of my practice, and I love collaborating with them —drawing upon their intrinsic wisdom and adaptability — to help them face the daunting challenges they face.  Together, we co-create a personal, private, space where a person can speak about his/her questions, changes, dilemmas, goals, and dreams.\n\t\t</p>\n\t</Layout>\n)","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/tay-2c06a1478bf2b290baf14bad38533884.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}

Some folks only need or require brief therapy to address temporary or situational challenges, whereas others may want a longer-term relationship to grapple with deeper, existential questions and challenges. Some folks come in due to a specific “problem” or “symptom”, while others come in due to vague or less specific forms of “discomfort” or a sense that something isn’t right.  Finally, some people come to therapy because their ways of dealing or coping are no longer working for them.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAt the same time, coming to therapy can be daunting, or intimidating, or shame-inducing, and for many folks, therapy isn’t something they thought they ever would’ve considered.  In this light, I respect your decision to even explore the possibility of therapy.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAs we explore your questions, your story, your “symptoms”, your history, your family, and your dreams (waking AND sleeping dreams), we may begin to identify themes, patterns, stuck points and knots, contradictions, and gaps.  Within the richness, pain, and struggle of these threads, our conversation will move towards some possible answers you can find to your questions, and some possible ways you can make meaning from what was once your suffering.  You may find that you have new and better ways to cope; you may find that you have an entirely new framework through which pain/suffering feel more livable and more tolerable; you may also find that you feel increased feelings of satisfaction, agency, and confidence.  And from there, you may find a sense of relief, and you may also find that new doorways and options that can open up for you.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI utilize an approach that blends humanistic/existential themes with psychodynamic and psychoanalytic perspectives, as well as cognitive approaches, all within a relational frame.  Together, we can create a space within which we can examine and understand your questions, where you can generate more complete, full-bodied, and multi-dimensional narratives, where you can consider important changes you may want to make, and where you can speak yourself more fully and with greater satisfaction.\n\t\t</p>\n\t</Layout>\n)","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/process-related-ebdfa2831c1f4a82bb86bf387821383f.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}

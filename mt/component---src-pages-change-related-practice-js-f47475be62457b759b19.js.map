To change now, or later?</h2>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMany people come to therapy to talk about “change”.  Some are “ready” to change, while others aren’t so sure or aren’t quite so ready; hence, they may not know what, if anything, they want to change, or what their timeframe is for changing.  Often times, folks are feeling torn or “stuck”; or maybe somebody in their life is telling them that they MUST change or is pressuring them to change; or maybe they’ve tried and haven’t yet been successful, and aren’t quite sure they actually CAN change?  And the more they are TOLD to change (by loved ones, by authorities, or even by therapists!), the more they want to dig their heels in.  What a dilemma!!\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI employ an approach called Motivational Interviewing (MI).  MI embodies a set of beliefs and principles about change, as well as specific skills and practices that help people speak about the places where they are stuck, understand more about why they may be stuck, and begin to consider the possibility of making some positive, health-promoting changes in their lives — changes that are more aligned with their own values and beliefs.  A big part of MI involves helping folks navigate the challenging waters of ambivalence (aka, indecision about changing).  Motivational Interviewing is a widely accepted “Best Practice” for helping people with the change-related issues in their lives.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI have worked with thousands of people who are wanting, or considering — but possibly struggling — to begin and sustain important changes in their lives.  This includes folks with drug/alcohol challenges, mental health questions and struggles, health-related changes, entrenched relationship and parenting patterns, and many other challenges.   My Motivational Interviewing approach allows me to listen deeply and fully to your questions and challenges and dilemmas, allowing us to create a reflective space within which you can articulate yourself in ever-fuller ways.  Through such an ongoing articulation, enduring change can be decided upon and moved towards.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>Change areas that many clients are pondering:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Drug and Alcohol Patterns</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Physical Health Patterns (i.e., Diet and Exercise)</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Smoking</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Mental Health Challenges, including whether or not to take medications</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Relationship Patterns</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Parenting Challenges, including discipline</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Whether to Change Jobs</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Whether to go back to school</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Whether to Stay in a Relationship</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t</Layout>\n)","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/change-related-2863cb479f50ec190cf6baa324a3f821.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}

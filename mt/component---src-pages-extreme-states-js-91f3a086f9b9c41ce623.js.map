Sometimes these states are called “mental illness”, “emotional problems”, “borderline personality disorder”, “bipolar disorder”, “schizophrenia”, etc.  Such states including:\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Psychosis</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Hearing Voices</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Intense and churning mood states (depression and mania)</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Intense Anger</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Powerful States of Fear and Mistrust (sometimes called “paranoia”)</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Troubling Thoughts and Racing Thoughts</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Difficult or Hard-To-Understand Beliefs</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Life-and-Death Questions (thinking about suicide)</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Self-Harm (cutting; burning; etc.)</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Questions About Psychiatric Medications</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe typical treatment for such experiences involves psychiatry and medication, and little else.  Indeed, many therapists will not work with folks who experience these things.  Throughout my career, I have welcomed folks in these states, and have worked with literally thousands of people who were undergoing such trying experiences.  \n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWorking together, we can co-create a relationship, and an environment, within which you can gain a better, deeper, understanding of your experiences; you can learn about their origins and their triggers; you can find ways to more effectively cope; and, mostly, you can articulate and make sense of your experiences in such a way that you can integrate them into a frame that has meaning.  We will create a space where your experiences, your words, and your silences, are welcomed and listened to; a place where your light, and your darkness, are held and explored and wondered about.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSometimes, we will incorporate your family and loved ones in to our work, IF (and only if) that’s something that feels right to you.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAnd finally, I want you to know that I will not panic or “freak out” or think about 5150 if you tell me some of the difficult things you are experiencing.  If I’m ever worried about your safety or someone else’s safety, I will let you know and we can find a solution together.  In this way, my office — and our relationship — will be a place where you can speak, even about dark and scary things, without having worry about me not being able to handle it.  Rest assured: I can. \n\t\t</p>\n\t</Layout>\n)","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/extreme-states-90052570c33b4adfcca78bf63e3eb625.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
